# Open-Concept Family Room Addition

This family room addition transformed a small, enclosed patio into a spacious, light-filled gathering space that seamlessly connects to the existing kitchen and dining areas. The project showcases our expertise in creating additions that feel like original parts of the home.

## Project Overview

**Location**: Renovation Valley, CA
**Timeline**: 8 weeks
**Budget Range**: $85,000 - $110,000
**Square Footage**: 350 sq ft addition

## The Challenge

The homeowners needed more space for their growing family but didn't want to move. Their existing home had a small, enclosed patio that was underutilized, and they wanted to create a proper family room for entertaining and daily family life.

Key challenges included:

- Limited existing space for family gatherings
- Enclosed patio that felt disconnected from the main house
- Need for better flow between kitchen and living areas
- Desire for more natural light and outdoor connection

We added a new electrical panel to handle the increased load and provide adequate outlets and lighting circuits for the new space.
